## ‚úÖ Post-Installation Steps (Important!)

Once the installation completes, follow these steps carefully to avoid potential overlay issues and signal damage to your CRT:

### üîå 1. Proper Shutdown After Script Installation

After installation finishes, type the following in the terminal:

```
shutdown -h now
```

This ensures Batocera saves the changes properly before powering off.  
Failing to do this may cause script installation errors due to the overlay not committing changes correctly.

Once the system has shut down completely, **power it back on to continue** with the setup.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important for CRT users:**  
Avoid having your CRT powered on or set to the same input **during BIOS/post boot**, especially if you're using a **15kHz-only CRT**. The default output sends **unsafe 31kHz signals** during early BIOS/post boot.

### üîÅ 2. First Boot After Installation ‚Äì Setup Instructions

Once your system is rebooted **with the CRT Script installed**, you must do the following:

1. Go to:  
   `MAIN MENU ‚Üí SYSTEM SETTINGS ‚Üí HARDWARE`

2. Set these values:

   - **VIDEO OUTPUT:**  
     Set this to the correct connected output. There should only be one listed.

   - **VIDEO MODE:**  
     Set this based on your chosen profile:

#### For 15kHz CRT Profiles

| Output Resolution | Recommended Video Mode Setting |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 640√ó480           | `Boot_480i 1.0:0:0 15KHz 60Hz`  |
| 768√ó576           | `Boot_576i 1.0:0:0 15KHz 50Hz`  |

#### For 31kHz (VGA) Profiles

| Output Resolution | Recommended Video Mode Setting |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 640√ó480           | `Boot_480i 1.0:0:0 31KHz 60Hz`  |

> üìù All profiles will have a `Boot_` prefix in the list.  
> üìù Make sure the **Boot_** entry you select matches the **exact resolution** you picked during installation.

## üß† Important Information:

The reason multiple monitors cannot be connected during setup is that Batocera's current implementation of multi-screen support can interfere with detecting the correct output.  

To avoid this, all outputs except the one in use must be disabled. It's essential that the output port you use during setup is the same one you will use for CRT output. **Following this step is crucial for proper configuration.**  

That said, you can still install the script locally using an LCD/OLED monitor, but it must be connected to the same output you plan to use for the CRT.  

**Guidelines for Specific Outputs:**  
- **VGA Output:**  
  * Use a VGA-to-VGA cable to connect an LCD/OLED monitor.  
  * Alternatively, use a VGA-to-HDMI or VGA-to-DP converter.  

- **DVI-I Output:**  
  * Use a DVI-I-to-DVI-I cable to connect an LCD/OLED monitor.  
  * Alternatively, use a DVI-I-to-HDMI or DVI-I-to-DP converter.  

You may also use an EDID emulator (also known as a dummy plug or headless display adapter) for VGA, DVI-I, or DP outputs to simplify setup.

## üíª Recommended Installation Method:

It‚Äôs still recommended to install the script via SSH, as it‚Äôs the quickest and most convenient method, provided the PC is connected to the same network.  

You **don‚Äôt need a second PC for this**‚Äîyour mobile phone or laptop can be used with an SSH client.  

   [üìé Batocera SSH Guide](https://wiki.batocera.org/access_the_batocera_via_ssh)

**Examples of SSH clients for iOS devices:**  
- Blink Shell  
- Termius  
- a-Shell  
- WebSSH  

**Examples of SSH clients for Android:**  
- ConnectBot  
- JuiceSSH  
- Termius  
- Termux

## üì• Installation

- Run the CRT Script
- Choose the correct input
- Select a correct monitor profile for your CRT
- Set resolution to 640x480/768x576  
  *(No official theme support for 320x240 at this point)*
- Set monitor rotation to "None", NORMAL (0¬∞)  
  *(Horizontal setup = Normal)*
- Press Enter and skip ADVANCED CONFIGURATION for all 4 options  
  *(If you don't know what they mean)*
- Default resolution for GunCon2 calibration is `320x240@60Hz`

### üåÄ Using curl (Command Line)

**v41**

- **bit.ly**
  ```bash
  bash <(curl -Ls https://bit.ly/batocera-crt-script | sed 's/\r$//')
  ```

- **Pastebin**
  ```bash
  bash <(curl -s https://pastebin.com/raw/iC21J0W6 | sed 's/\r$//')
  ```

- **QR Code for Mobile:**  
  ![](https://github.com/ZFEbHVUE/Batocera-CRT-Script/blob/main/wiki_page/bit.ly_batocera-crt-script_small.png)

> This command chain downloads the latest version, extracts its contents, moves the folder, sets script permissions, preserves backups (if any), and finally executes the script.

**Note:** If your graphics card is an **R9 380**, rerun the setup after first boot:

```bash
/userdata/system/Batocera-CRT-Script/Batocera_ALLINONE/./Batocera-CRT-Script-v41.sh
```

---

## üì¶ Manual Installation

Use this if installing via wired or wireless network manually.

Before running the script:
- Connect the correct output on your GPU to the correct cable.
- Ensure your CRT is either **off** or on a **different AV channel** during setup.

### Steps:

1. Press the **Code** button on GitHub and choose **Download ZIP**

2. Extract `Batocera-CRT-Script-main.zip` into a temporary folder on your PC

3. Access Batocera over your network:  
   [üìé Batocera Network File Transfer Guide](https://wiki.batocera.org/add_games_bios?s[]=transfer#add_games_bios_files_to_batocera)

4. Drag and drop the `system` folder into `/userdata`  
   *(Via SMB, you're already in `/userdata`)*

5. Connect via SSH:  
   [üìé Batocera SSH Guide](https://wiki.batocera.org/access_the_batocera_via_ssh)

6. In SSH terminal, run the following:

```bash
cd /userdata/system/Batocera-CRT-Script/Batocera_ALLINONE
chmod 755 Batocera-CRT-Script-v41.sh
./Batocera-CRT-Script-v41.sh
```

You'll be greeted with a welcome message.  
Press Enter and follow the onscreen instructions.
