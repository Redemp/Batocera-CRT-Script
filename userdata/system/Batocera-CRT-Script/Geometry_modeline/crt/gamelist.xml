		<desc>GunCon2 Calibration How To

You only need to do a first calibration once

* Start the calibration by pressing the gun trigger.
* Follow the onscreen instructions and aim at all the 4 circles with the cross in the middle.
* Try to be as exact as possible.
* The result will not be perfect even if you aimed exactly in the middle using the GunCon2's crosshair.
* This is normal..
			  
* Exit the script and save the settings by pressing A or B</desc>
